## What is Live?

Live is a mode in CodeSandbox that allows you to share your sandbox with others
for real time collaboration on code. You can simultaneously create, delete, edit and
move files and code with others in a sandbox, as well as chat about your changes. It's like Google Docs, but for coding.

## Going Live

You can go live by pressing the 'Go Live' button under the Live tab in the left-hand activity bar in the editor. This
will give you a URL that you can share with others to join the session. Invited editors
can only make edits to the sandbox while they are in the live session, they
cannot do this when just viewing the sandbox.

Invited editors can simultaneously edit, create, rename and update files and code, as well as add and remove dependencies. You can also see which file other collaborators are looking at and what their current selections are.

## Classroom Mode

With Classroom Mode you can define who can edit the sandbox. This is especially
useful when working with large groups. You will only see the cursors of the
users that are 'editor'.

You can enable Classroom Mode from the Live Mode drop-down menu.
