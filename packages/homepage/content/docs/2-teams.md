  A workspace makes it easier to collaborate on sandboxes with others. In a workspace you
  share ownership of the sandboxes so you can all work on them.

## Creating a Workspace

You can create and manage workspaces from the dashboard.

As soon as you've created a workspace you will be shown the team overview.

## Inviting People to a Workspace

There's no limit on how many members a workspace can have. You can invite others
by entering their username or email address and selecting 'Add Member'. They will get a
notification (the bell icon in the header) in CodeSandbox and email when they are invited
to a new workspace. From there they can accept or decline the invitation.

## Sharing Sandboxes

On the dashboard, you can choose which workspace you're in from the workspace drop-down at 
the top-left. You can create new sandboxes
directly from here, or from a difference workspace, select one or more sandboxes, right-click 
and select 'Move to Folder', where you can choose the workspace and folder you want to move 
them into. All sandboxes in a workspace can be seen and edited by all team members.
We keep track of who originally created the sandbox though, and only the
original creator of the sandbox can delete it.

## Collaborating on Sandboxes

You can other members can open a sandbox at the same time and see each other's cursor to work 
together. You can still invite other people who aren't members of the team to the sandbox or 
[live session](/docs/live).
