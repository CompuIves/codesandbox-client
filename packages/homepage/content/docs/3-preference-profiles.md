## Preferences Profiles

Save a snapshot of your current preferences as a profile, which you can then
apply to re-use them when youâ€™re on another device.

## How to create a new Preference Profile?

To save a snapshot of your CodeSandbox preferences you can open your
`Preferences` located in the menu available in the upper most top right of your
screen.

In there navigate to `Preferences Profiles` and you can now see a button saying
`Create new profile`:

![Create a Profile](./images/preferences-create.png)

By clicking it we will save your preferences on the cloud so that they can be
retrieved later and applied in another computer.

## Can I have more than one Profile?

Right now we only have the possibility to create on profile but this will change
in the future.
