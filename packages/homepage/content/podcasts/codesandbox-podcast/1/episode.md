description: "Netlify is known as one of the fastest-growing platforms for high-performance
websites and apps. Dozens of big companies use Netlify -- including Figma,
Shopify, Mailchimp, and Nike -- and to date, they have onboarded over a million
other businesses and developers to their platform.

On this week's episode of Version One, we take a look at Netlify's beginning
product journey from its CEO and co-founder, Matt Biilmann. Listen as Matt talks
about his early career as a music journalist, partnering up with his best friend
(and Netlify co-founder) Chris Bach, and learn about the triumphs and challenges
they faced while building their way to the successful first version of their
product."
