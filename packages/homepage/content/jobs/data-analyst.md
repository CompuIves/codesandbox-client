## Role

We’re looking to hire our first Data Science professional to establish and utilize a data platform to help teams across CodeSandbox make informed, effective decisions. We track millions of events across our web application and want to use this data to help drive insights, identify opportunities, and understand trends. As the first data hire, you will build the foundations upon which we'll create a data-driven culture. You will define the long-term vision from an organizational, technical, and analytical perspective.

Initially working within the growth team, you'll own the design and development of our data warehousing system and pipelines, working with fellow engineers to build out or select the tools necessary. You'll also own analysis and modeling and will create and monitor key metrics through consistent tracking, KPIs, and dashboards.

Partnering with teams across the business, like product, growth, and ops, you'll help them utilize data in their day-to-day work. This might involve ad-hoc analyses to provide actionable insights, brainstorming new growth experiments, advising on experiment design, or assisting with product development. Product development at CodeSandbox is peer-led and built around autonomous teams. These teams ideate, scope, and implement a feature from start to finish. You'll assist by guiding individuals on the right data to track and KPIs to follow to measure success.

## We'll be looking for

- Proven ability to perform statistical analysis and extensive experience with SQL.
- Business Acumen: you have a strong understanding of business, and you prioritize analytical projects by business impact.
- Ability to synthesize data from multiple sources to drive actionable insights.
- Problem-solver: you have a knack for rapid and effective problem-solving. You strive to find the most elegant solution in every situation, balancing speed with quality.
- Prior hands-on experience developing data infrastructure and maintaining data pipelines in a high-growth environment.
- Some experience with one or more general-purpose programming languages, such as Python.
- Experience with cloud data warehousing such as Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift preferred.
- Strong communication skills, using data analysis and visualization to explain complex concepts to those without a data background.
- Examples of your ability to develop and socialize a culture of experimentation inside a company.

## Our offer
