## Role

As a product growth engineer, you'll work on identifying and shipping the largest opportunities to improve the customer experience on CodeSandbox and accelerate our growth.

By combining an understanding of product user behavior and customer pain points, you'll help build new customer-facing product experiences, integrations, and incrementally reduce friction and/or improve discoverability of underutilized existing functionality. This will range from small experiments to larger projects and cover features aimed at paying teams and our wider community users. To succeed, you'll need to communicate with teammates frequently and collaborate with the core product engineering team and designers.

You'll look to prove the value of new ideas as early as possible. Then work to understand which opportunities will have the greatest impact, generate experiment ideas, implement them, and iterate based on results. As well as work with Data Science to ensure we're collecting the right data to support analysis and inform further experimentation.

The ideal candidate has prior experience working in a start or scale up and is self-directed, results-driven, curious, creative, and experimental, yet has the resilience to learn from failure, apply it to their work and keep shipping.

## We'll be looking for

- Proven full-stack engineering experience with knowledge of React, Typescript, and NodeJS and web dev best practices.
- Familiarity with analytics and experience in running A/B tests.
- Experience working with a remote team, across multiple timezones.
- Someone mindful of the tradeoffs between quality and shipping fast.
- Proven success building web applications as well as working with 3rd party APIs and creating data pipelines.

## Our offer

- A friendly, remote-first working environment
- Flexible working hours
- Generous vacation
- Choose your own equipment  
- Sick and parental leave
