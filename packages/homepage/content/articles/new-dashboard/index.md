## A New-look Dashboard

The dashboard is a core part of working on CodeSandbox, and it's of increasing
importance to power users and teams. While staying close to what people are
familiar with, we've refreshed the design of the dashboard. This update evolves
the design to bring through the
[updates made in the editor](https://codesandbox.io/post/new-look-editor) and
makes working with more people and more sandboxes a better experience. But these
changes aren't just cosmetic; they add new functionality that gives you greater
control and organizational capabilities to boost collaboration.

### A new start screen

You now start from the home screen. This lists only the last few templates and
sandboxes you've used—the stuff you're most likely to want to dive in to. We've
also added a 'recent' section, which shows the sandboxes modified today, in the
last seven days, as well as within the last month. So you no longer need to
trawl through a big list of sandboxes to pick out a new sandbox you want to
carry on with.

### My Drafts

With that said, you don't need to go back to most of the sandboxes you create.
That's part of the value of CodeSandbox, but this wasn't catered to by the old
dashboard design. So we've added a new section called 'Drafts' that collects
together all the sandboxes you don't categorize yourself. Such projects would
clutter the old dashboard and make the projects you did want to go back to
harder to find. By default, new projects now go into drafts.

### Workspaces

Workspaces are where teams of people can create and organize sandboxes together.
They enable you to keep your personal and work projects separate, as well as
manage sandboxes more effectively. You can invite other people to a workspace so
you can collaborate on code together. You might want to create one or more
workspaces to work with different teams, or on various projects. In the future,
you'll be able to set workspace-level settings and secrets too.

### Repositories

The last new section is 'Repositories.' This is a folder specifically for the
projects you've imported from GitHub. This puts imported GitHub repos just a
click away to open or fork, making them as easy to work with as templates
created on CodeSandbox. This new folder is part of a broader change to the
[GitHub experience on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/post/better-github-workflow),
which we're also releasing today.

### Other dashboard improvements

There are other UX improvements too. There's now a list view, perfect for those
with a large number of sandboxes. The dashboard is keyboard accessible, so you
can move around and open sandboxes using only keys. The design is responsive, so
you can get to your sandboxes quicker when you're on mobile, and we've tweaked
drag-and-drop to make it easier to move groups of sandboxes between folders.

## Notifications

We've also updated the design of notifications. You're forgiven if you didn't
know we have notifications—they've only been used for team invitations in the
dashboard to date. Now they're shown in the editor as well and let you know
about new sandbox invitations too. Notifications will become increasingly useful
as we deliver on more of our
[planned collaboration features](https://codesandbox.io/post/redefining-code-collaboration),
which is why we've also added new filter and dismiss options.

## Join the Team Pro waiting list

For individuals, these updates make the dashboard a more productive starting
point to jump back into projects and improves working with large numbers of
sandboxes.

For teams, it's a big step forward in being able to collaborate.

to be one of the first to try other upcoming collaboration features that will
forever change how you work with others to create things with code.
