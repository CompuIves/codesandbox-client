### Redefining Code Collaboration

CodeSandbox Live made collaboration easier by giving you the ability to code in
real-time with others. It's used for pair programming, at hackathons, during job
interviews, and in classrooms, enabling two or more folks to work on code
simultaneously. What's more, our [basic team support](/dashboard/teams/new) has
reduced friction in sharing ownership of sandboxes within a group.
